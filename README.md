LedgerNet is a distributed ledger platform that leverages the UTXO model and ED25519 cryptography for secure and efficient transactions. The platform uses Protocol Buffers for compact data serialization and gRPC for low-latency communication between nodes. LedgerNet's consensus mechanism is based on proof-of-stake (POS), which provides a more sustainable and decentralized alternative to proof-of-work (POW). The platform is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to add new features and functionality. LedgerNet is an ideal choice for building decentralized applications that require fast, secure, and scalable blockchain infrastructure."
